SlideBlurTableViewCell
======================

This helps you build make a TableViewCell with a blured UIView on it
Looks like the Blur effect is live ,and in fact it's just a small trick to let the users think it is live blur effect

the usage is written it the demo and BlurTableViewCell_Mark1.h

I'm a beginner ,So I look forward to your Pull Requests, thank you
